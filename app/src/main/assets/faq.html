                                That is totally between you and the driver. Driver has the discretion to refuse to help and also to cancel the order.

                              21.  What are the documents you expect from customers?

                                <p>
                                We do not need any specific documents from the customers. But at the time of collecting the goods at the pickup point, the driver takes the customer’s signature on the Customer Acknowledgement screen in his/her mobile app which basically is a declaration from the customer as to the contents of the package being transported.
                                </p>

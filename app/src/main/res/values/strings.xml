    <string name="about_text">Whizzy allows you, an individual or a business,to avoid unnecessary time and money that is typically spent in traffic in order to run errands or deliver goods to customers.\n\nWhizzy provides a convenient platform to summon a person and vehicle on demand that meets your specific requirements. It is like having a domestic help and/or a driver at your service on the click of a button.</string>
    <string name="about_text1">Currently we are operating in Hyderabad city only.</string>
    <string name="faq">FAQ</string>
    <string name="faq_text">How can Whizzy help me?\n\nWhizzy is a technology platform that enables logistic services with respect to intra-city on-demand pickup and drop off of goods by connecting customers (individuals/businesses) with vehicles that meet their specific needs.\nUsing the Whizzy platform, you can have the convenience of getting anything picked up or dropped off at your home just at the click of a button. Some of the many use cases include: birthday cake delivery, pickup(drop off)clothes at(from) dry cleaners, send flowers to customer’s location, deliver furniture to customer, drop off documents, pay utility bills, collect altered clothes from store, etc.\n\n\n
    How does Whizzy work?\n\nDownload our app, WHIZZY, from Playstore or Appstore to book a vehicle of your choice. We will match and send the nearest driver available matching your need to the pickup location. Driver picks up the goods and heads to the drop off location given by you. You can track the driver during the trip. Driver delivers the goods and completed the trip. Your account gets charged automatically for the trip amount. You can provide your feedback by rating the driver and giving any other suggestions.\n\n\n
    How much will I be charged?\n\nWhizzy charges based on the vehicle type and the distance between the pickup and drop off points. Additionally, there might be a waiting charge depending on the order. The costs are system calculated and given to you before the order is confirmed.\n\n\n
    How do I pay and what are the payment options?\n\nAt present, we require customers to have a PayTM wallet app on their mobile phone. Our app is closely integrated with PayTM and auto collects the trip fee amount once the trip has been completed. We will also introduce other payment options including debit cards and credit cards in due course.\n\n\n
    My PayTM account was incorrectly charged?\n\nIf you believe that your PayTM wallet has been charged incorrectly for any trip, you can go to that particular trip details under Your Trips in the menu section and raise a ticket which will then be addressed by customer care representative in a timely manner. Alternatively, you can send an email to support@whizzy.in with the trip details and a brief about the discrepancy.\n\n\n
    How do I track my order?\n\nTo track a current trip, open your app on the mobile and click on Your Trips in the menu section. Under “Ongoing Trips”, we will show in real-time the movement of your vehicle in a map-view, along with notifications upon successful deliveries at the trip destinations. Further, the driver collects signatures and recipient details at each destination which can be seen from here.\n\n\n
    What goods are permitted on Whizzy?\n\nWe accept all goods that are not under our list of prohibited items and are suitable to be transported in the vehicles safely based on payload and capacity requirements.\n\n\n
    What if my pickup/drop off locationis too far?\n\nIn order to optimize the trip, we will attempt to find a driver close to your pickup location. Drivers accepting trips are willing to travel to any location near or far because they get to see the pickup and drop locations prior to accepting.\n\n\n
    What if the drop off contact is not available when the driver arrives?\n\nIn case the drop off contact person that you have provided is unavailable at the time the driver reaches the destination, the driver is permitted to drop off the goods with any other recipient willing to accept the goods in which case their contact details as well as their signature is captured in our system and will be shared with you.\n\n\n
    Can I cancel the trip once I have made the booking?\n\nYou can cancel the booking at any time until the driver has arrived at the pickup location, picked up the goods, and started the trip towards the drop off location. However, you would not incur any charges if the cancellation is done within 5 (five) minutes of booking the trip.\n\nAny cancellations done after 5 (five) minutes of booking the trip but before the driver is en route to the destination will incur charges of Rs. _______.\n\nOnce a driver has pickup up the goods and is en route to the drop off location, the customer is charged for the entire trip plus an amount that depends on the time and distance spent by the driver to come back to the original location to return the goods.\n\n\n
    Can the driver arrive at the pickup location and refuse to continue?\n\nWe leave it to the discretion of the driver to accept or reject transporting the goods once he arrives at the pickup location. The driver may reject the trip in the following situations: a) wrong vehicle chosen for the job, b) fragile item; too risky or not safe, c) goods not properly sealed/packed; unsafe, d) hazardous goods, e) prohibited goods, f) customer’s reluctance to sign the contents declaration/acknowledgement form, g) vehicle breakdown.\n\n\n
    Can I entrust my goods with the driver?\n\nWe have a driver onboarding process that involves submission of documents by the drivers which are thoroughly checked and validated by our operations personnel. Drivers are on boarded only after the verifications are completed and driver has gone through the mandatory training classes. However, we would urge our customers to use caution and discretion when it comes to sending sensitive goods such as jewelry. As a matter of fact, we do not recommend our customers send items/goods such as jewelry, cash, blank signed cheques, original property documents, etc. with the drivers. Customers should be aware that the risk will be borne entirely by them in case of loss/theft/damage to such goods being transported. Please refer to our Terms of Service for more details.\n\n\n
    I suspect that the driver tampered with the goods while transporting?\n\nWe train our drivers thoroughly and have them agree to a code of conduct while dealing with orders and customers. We take complaints about drivers very seriously and will take strict action against any driver found to be guilty. Kindly bring any incident to our attention by sending an email to support@whizzy.in and we will promptly address it to your satisfaction.\n\n\n
    Will my goods be covered by insurance?\n\nAlthough we make every effort to have your goods delivered safely, your goods however are not insured by us and we will not be responsible for any damages incurred during transportation.\n\nYou have the option of buying insurance when you book an order with Whizzy.\n\nFor further details, please refer to our Terms of Service.\n\n\n
    Will the Whizzy driver help with the loading and/or unloading of goods?\n\nWhizzy drivers shall not be obliged to load/unload the goods, but may be willing to help on a friendly basis.\n\n\n
    Can I pay the driver extra for loading and unloading of goods?\n\nThat is totally between you and the driver. Driver has the discretion to refuse to help and also to cancel the order.\n\n\n
    Will you provide labor for loading and unloading of goods?\n\nNo.\n\n\n
    What are the documents you expect from customers?\n\nWe do not need any specific documents from the customers. But at the time of collecting the goods at the pickup point, the driver takes the customer’s signature on the Customer Acknowledgement screen in his mobile app which basically is a declaration from the customer as to the contents of the package being transported.\n\n\n
    Will my account details be safe?\n\nYes, all transactions that are done using our website www.whizzy.in and our mobile app WHIZZY are safe and secure. For more details, please refer to our Terms of Service and to our Privacy Policy.\n\n\n</string>

    <string name="faqs_text"> \'How can Whizzy help me?
Whizzy is a technology platform that enables logistic services and helps customers (individuals/businesses) to get anything done by providing them drivers to fulfill their specific needs.
Using the Whizzy platform, you can have the convenience of getting anything done from the comfort of your home just at the click of a button. We offer three types of services, namely, i) Buy, ii) Pickup/Drop, and iii) Other Services.
Some of the many use cases for Buy include:
•	Get me a birthday cake
•	Buy a flower bouquet
•	Get me medicines
Some of the many use cases for Pickup/Dropinclude:
•	Get my lunch box from home
•	Bring my laptop charger
•	Get my dress from tailor
Some of the many use cases for Other Servicesinclude:
•	Deposit my cheque
•	Pay my bills
•	Get me cash
 How does Whizzy work?
Using the WHIZZY app, which is available in Playstore and Appstore, you can request us to send the nearest driver available matching your need to the pickup location. Driver picks up the goods and heads to the drop off location given by you. You can track the driver during the trip. Driver delivers the goods and completes the trip. You will be prompted to pay for the trip amount. You can rate the driver regarding the trip.
 How much will I be charged?
Whizzy charges based on the distance between the pickup and drop off points. Additionally, there might be a waiting charge depending on the order. The costs are system calculated and given to you before the order is confirmed.
 How do I pay and what are the payment options?
At present, customers are offered to pay using credit/debit cards, Wallets (Freecharge and Ola Money), Net Banking. Customers can also choose to pay later by selecting the SIMPL https://getsimpl.com/) payment service (if eligible).
 What is SIMPL payment option and how does it work?
Simpl gives you the flexibility to pay a merchant using “Simpl” as a payment option. Simpl consolidates all such payments you make to various merchants and sends you a bill every two weeks. You then review the statement and pay them in one go. For more information, please visit their website https://getsimpl.com/.
 How do I pay if my order involved buying something?
Once the driver arrives at the merchant location, he will call you to tell the price and get your approval to purchase. At the time of delivery, the driver will hand over the receipt for your records and request you to make the payment to us from your app before delivering the goods to you.
 How will I know the purchase price of something that I asked the driver to buy for me?
If the driver is buying from an established merchant location who gives a receipt, the driver would scan the receipt and send it across in the app as well as give hand over the receipt to you at the time of delivery. In the instance where merchant didn’t provide a receipt (such as akirana store, Xerox shop, street side food vendor, etc.) then the driver would first call you and let you know of the amount and get your approval before purchasing the item(s).
 Can I pay using cash?
Although we prefer that payment be made digitally (using cards, wallets, net banking), we will accept cash if that’s the only choice for the customer.
 I was incorrectly charged
If you believe that you have been charged incorrectly for any trip, you can go to that particular trip details under Your Trips in the menu section and raise a ticket which will then be addressed by customer care representative in a timely manner. Alternatively, you can send an email to support@whizzy.in with the trip details and a brief about the discrepancy.
 How do I track my order?
You will be able to check the driver status at various stages of the request as well as track the movement of the vehicle assigned for the ongoing trip in real-time in a map-view, along with notifications upon successful delivery at the trip destination.
 What goods are permitted on Whizzy?
We accept all goods that are not under our list of prohibited items and are suitable to be transported in the vehicles safely based on payload and capacity requirements. For more details, please refer to our Terms of Service.
 What if my pickup/drop off location is too far?
In order to optimize the trip, we will attempt to find a driver close to your pickup location. Drivers accepting trips are willing to travel to any location near or far in order to fulfill your request.
 Can I cancel the trip once I have made the booking?
You can cancel the booking at any time until the driver has arrived at the pickup location, picked up the goods, and started the trip towards the drop off location. However, you would not incur any charges if the cancellation is done within 5 (five) minutes of booking the trip.
Any cancellations done after 5 (five) minutes of booking the trip but before the driver is en route to the destination will incur charges of Rs. 20 (Rupees Twenty).
Once a driver has pickup up the goods and is en route to the drop off location, the customer is charged for the entire trip plus an amount that depends on the time and distance spent by the driver to come back to the original location to return the goods..

 Can the driver arrive at the pickup location and refuse to continue?
We leave it to the discretion of the driver to accept or reject transporting the goods once he arrives at the pickup location. The driver may reject/cancel the trip in the following situations: a) fragile item; too risky or not safe, b) goods not properly sealed/packed; unsafe, c) hazardous goods, d) prohibited goods, e) customer’s reluctance to sign the contents declaration/acknowledgement form, f) vehicle breakdown.
 Can I entrust my goods with the driver?
We have a driver onboarding process that involves submission of documents by the drivers which are thoroughly checked and validated by our operations personnel. Drivers are on boarded only after the verifications are completed and driver has gone through the mandatory training classes. However, we would urge our customers to use caution and discretion when it comes to sending any sensitive items or precious goods. As a matter of fact, we do not recommend our customers send items/goods such as jewellery, cash, blank signed cheques, original property documents, etc. with the drivers. Customers should be aware that the risk will be borne entirely by them in case of loss/theft/damage to such goods being transported. Please refer to our Terms of Service for more details.
 I suspect that the driver tampered with the goods while transporting
We train our drivers thoroughly and have them agree to a code of conduct while dealing with orders and customers. We take complaints about drivers very seriously and will take strict action against any driver found to be guilty. Kindly bring any incident to our attention by sending an email to support@whizzy.in and we will promptly address it to your satisfaction.
 Will my goods be covered by insurance?
Although we make every effort to have your goods delivered safely, your goods however are not insured by us and we will not be responsible for any damages incurred during transportation.
For further details, please refer to our Terms of Service.
 Will the Whizzy driver help with the loading and/or unloading of goods?
Whizzy drivers shall not be obliged to load/unload the goods, but may be willing to help on a friendly basis.
 Can I pay the driver extra for loading and unloading of goods?
That is totally between you and the driver. Driver has the discretion to refuse to help and also to cancel the order.
 Will you provide labor for loading and unloading of goods?
No.
 What are the documents you expect from customers?
We do not need any specific documents from the customers. But at the time of collecting the goods at the pickup point, the driver takes the customer’s signature on the Customer Acknowledgement screen in his/her mobile app which basically is a declaration from the customer as to the contents of the package being transported.
 Will my account details be safe?
Yes, all transactions that are done using our website www.whizzy.in and our mobile app WHIZZY are safe and secure. For more details, please refer to our Terms of Service and to our Privac
